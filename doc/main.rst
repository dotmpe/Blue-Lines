Ideas
  - I very much like to support the ``toctree`` from Sphinx into Blue Lines.
    Perhaps subdocs from docutils SVN is usable.
  - Note that there are also Du branches for nested markup and lossless rst
  	writing.  
  - A directive for Google charts.
  - A directive for embedded video.  
  - An easily extendible system for parsed entity references, similar to current
  	RFC/PEP parsing. E.g. Wikipedia, Debian packages, Gnome bugzilla, Bitzi, 
  	MusicBrainz, etc..
