Blue Lines development notes.
  - `introduction <introduction.rst>`_
  - `app-engine <app-engine.rst>`__  
  - `nabu <nabu.rst>`__  

Design drafts
  - `BL1 <drafts/2010-001-bvb-document-identification.rst>`_

Suggested implementations
  - I very much like to support the ``toctree`` from Sphinx into Blue Lines.
    Perhaps subdocs from docutils SVN is usable.


RFC 2616.
